Programmed in python. Uses brute force to generate all valid states of a board if there are no obvious moves. Calculates around 5000 states / second. Uses a command line interface, and prints the current state of the stack, as well as the guess it is performing. Because it explicitly guesses randomly, passing in a fully blank sudoku turns it into a sudoku generator. Setting the random seed will generate a unique puzzle for that seed.
